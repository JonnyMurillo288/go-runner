# go-runner

### What is this package?
This package is just graphs and algorithms for the graphs that I learned from the Coursera course 
called Algorithms. 

[Here](https://github.com/JonnyMurillo288/GoUtils) is where I keep the main data structures created and used throughout the course

None of the algorithms are special, and I don't recommend using as there are much better alternatives, this is just a reference for myself to see how to build new graphs and basic algorithmic work
